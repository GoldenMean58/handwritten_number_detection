# handwritten_number_detection
Detect the handwritten number with Tensorflow Keras datasets API and mnist database.

# Installation
1. Install python3.7.4
2. Install requirements(tensorflow==1.14.0, Keras==2.2.5, matplotlib==3.1.1)

	Run `pip install -r requirements.txt --user` in the directory

# Usage
1. Run the python script `python3 main.py`. It will download mnist databases automatically.
2. It will prompt a menu with three options, and then you can detect the handwritten numbers in the mnist databases with 10000 pictures for test. Or practise your own model.

# Note
1. The practised model is named as `my_model.h5`, and I had finished a model for you, so you can run detection directly.
